GLU_V2 - Within this folder contains files created to be for testing street lights in the Sterling Ranch project.
    1. In side you will find GLU_V4...open that in a browser. This is a full response web application. 
    2. Street Light is created In adobe Illustrator. Full vector.SVG file.
        a. The code contained in the SVG file I have figured out can be used with Javascript and an API developed at Siemens to interact with the commands of the web application. Basically, The beacon on the top will respond to the colors testing. and will not change if the test fails.
        b. The LED lights will light up based on the percentage of brightness. So if 30% is selected then 30 percent will change to a yellow color
    3. Unfortunately I these features are only viewable as the system is hosted live on a server. The front end is still functional within the browser.
